## 🔄 User Flow

### **Before (No Protection)**
```
1. User views hotel details
2. User clicks "Select Room"
3. Booking modal opens
4. User fills details
5. Payment proceeds (no auth check!)
❌ Security risk!
```

### **After (Protected)**
```
1. User views hotel details (public)
2. User clicks "Select Room" or "Login to Book"
3. IF NOT LOGGED IN:
   → Redirect to /auth/login?redirect=/hotels/123
   → User logs in
   → Redirect back to /hotels/123
   → Booking proceeds
4. IF LOGGED IN:
   → Booking proceeds directly
✅ Secure!
```

## 🔍 Code Snippets

### **How Login Protection Works**

```tsx
import { useRequireAuth } from '@/hooks/useRequireAuth'

export default function HotelDetailPage() {
  const { requireAuth, isAuthenticated } = useRequireAuth()
  
  const handleBooking = (roomTypeId: string) => {
    // Check if user is authenticated
    if (!requireAuth()) {
      // User is NOT logged in
      // → Automatically redirected to /auth/login?redirect=<current-page>
      return
    }
    
    // User IS logged in
    // → Continue with booking
    setShowBookingModal(true)
  }
  
  return (
    <button onClick={handleBooking}>
      {isAuthenticated() ? 'Select Room' : '🔒 Login to Book'}
    </button>
  )
}
```

2. **Redirect to login:** `/auth/login?redirect=/client/hotels/123`
3. **User logs in successfully**
4. **Backend sets httpOnly cookie** with JWT
5. **Frontend redirects back:** `/client/hotels/123`
6. **User can now book!** ✅

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Button still shows "Select Room" when not logged in**

**Solution:** 
- Clear browser cache
- Check console for `isAuthenticated()` value
- Ensure `useRequireAuth` is imported

---

### **Issue: After login, not redirected back to hotel page**

**Solution:**
- Check URL has `?redirect=` parameter
- Verify `getRedirectUrl()` function in login page
- Check browser console for errors

---

### **Issue: Login required but button doesn't show "Login to Book"**

**Solution:**
- Check `isAuthenticated` prop is passed to component
- Verify `useRequireAuth` hook is being used
- Check component re-renders after auth state changes
